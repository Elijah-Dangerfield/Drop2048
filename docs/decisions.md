# Architecture decisions

Append-only log. Add an entry whenever you make a non-trivial architectural call
(new module boundary, library choice, scope cut, schema shape). Each entry: date,
the decision, alternatives considered, and *why*. Newest first.

## 2026-06-21 — Server mirrors client conventions

**Decision:** `:apps:server` reuses the client's stack — kotlin-inject + anvil DI
(`ServerScope`/`ServerComponent`), the `domain/` interface + `data/` impl split,
conventional commits, the version catalog. It's a plain JVM `application` module
(no convention plugin; those are KMP-only).

**Why:** one mental model across client and server. An agent (or human) moving
between them doesn't re-learn DI, error handling, or module layout. The cost —
the server can't use the KMP `:libraries:core` (`Catching`, logging) because that
module has no JVM target — was accepted; the server keeps a couple of small local
equivalents rather than forcing a `jvm()` target onto every client library.

## 2026-06-21 — Graceful degradation over required config

**Decision:** `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SENTRY_DSN`, and the OTLP endpoint
are all optional. With none set, the server boots and serves `/_health` +
`/v1/example`; DB-backed and authenticated routes simply aren't mounted, Sentry
no-ops, and OpenTelemetry exports to stdout.

**Alternatives:** require `DATABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_URL` like the Cards origin
(fail-fast). **Why optional:** this is a template — "clone and run, see it boot"
beats a fail-fast error on first run. The fail-fast discipline still applies per
field via `Env.require` when a future field genuinely can't be defaulted.

## 2026-06-21 — Auth is JWKS verification, never a shared secret

**Decision:** the server verifies Supabase JWTs against the project's public keys
(JWKS / ES256). The `JwtVerification` sealed seam has `Jwks` (prod) and `Static`
(tests mint HS256 tokens against a known verifier).

**Why:** no Supabase secret ever lives on the server, and auth — the highest-risk
surface — is fully testable offline (route tests + `FullStackMeTest` run the real
validate/challenge path with no network).

## 2026-06-21 — `NoOpAuthTokenProvider` lives in the `:networking` api module

**Decision:** the default no-op `AuthTokenProvider` binding sits in
`:libraries:networking` (api), not `:impl`.

**Why:** the module-boundary rule forbids one `:impl` depending on another, but
`:libraries:identity:impl` must reference `NoOpAuthTokenProvider` to override it
with `@ContributesBinding(replaces = [NoOpAuthTokenProvider::class])`. Putting the
default binding next to the interface it defaults keeps the replacement
boundary-clean. (See also the `enforceModuleBoundaries` self-edge fix in
`build-logic`.)

## 2026-06-21 — `serverOnly` build slimming

**Decision:** `-Ddrop2048.serverOnly=true` makes `settings.gradle.kts` include
only `:apps:server`, so a Docker image build needs no Android/iOS toolchain.

**Why:** this is a KMP monorepo; without slimming, a server image build would
configure every client module and need the Android SDK + Kotlin/Native. The
server has no client-library deps today, so the gate is a pure settings change;
if it gains one, add an always-included `include(...)` + a Dockerfile `COPY`.

## 2026-06-21 — Flyway SQL is the schema source of truth

**Decision:** migrations under `resources/db/migration` define the schema; the
Exposed `Tables.kt` objects are read-side projections kept honest by
`DatabaseSchemaTest`. Repositories treat a unique-violation (SQLSTATE `23505`) as
the arbiter rather than pre-checking for races.

**Why:** one procedure for schema change (add the next `V##__name.sql`, never edit
an applied one), and idempotency that's correct under concurrency.

## 2026-09-09 — Ports considered and rejected

**Decision:** three things a downstream app offered back are deliberately not in
this template. Recorded so they don't get re-proposed each time someone reads
that app's setup and notices the gap.

- **Macrobenchmark `FrameTimingMetric` in CI.** The right tool for catching jank
  regressions, and it needs a real device. Emulator frame timing on a shared CI
  runner varies more run-to-run than the regressions worth catching, so any
  threshold produces flaky red and gets disabled within a month. Only worth it
  for a project with a device farm. Real-user frame timing (`app.jank`) covers
  the same question continuously and is in the template instead.
- **The Grafana dashboards themselves.** The queries encode one app's event
  names. The *conventions* are portable and already carried; the boards are not.
- **The observability routine and its skills.** Genuinely useful, and shaped
  entirely around one project's dashboards, alert ids and inbox. Revisit only if
  a second app wants the same thing — that is the point at which the generic
  shape becomes visible.

**Why here rather than the port queue:** the queue is work waiting to happen, and
these are closed questions. Keeping them there made an empty queue impossible.
